# linalg

this is a personal project of mine to compute the concepts learned in math 0280. currently all it does is find the determinant of a square matrix

it utilizes the java swing library to create a gui that takes in inputs from the user to create an matrix of a size of their choosing. the deterimnant is computed recursively using an algorithm that i implemented

no external math libraries were used

to run the file, run 'mycalc.java' in src. 'functions.java' in src is also required for the file to run.
